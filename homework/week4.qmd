# What is tmux and how does this relate to our current way of working on raven?
tmux is a terminal multiplexer. They allow a session with multiple windows, each running their own processes. They can allow a session to persist if the terminal window is closed or quit. All sessions can be reattached to whatever terminal youâ€™re currently on.

# What is ssh and what would the code be you would type if you were going to ssh into raven?
SSH stands for secure shell, and allows for secure remote login and file access.

The code for accessing Raven would be ssh rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu

# What has been the most challenging part of your research project? Are you happy with your organization skills? If not what could be improved?
One of the things I did last week was create some subdirectories to organize the intermediate files. I'm happy with the result; my project folder isn't giving me anxiety. But let me know if you see any issues here. 

The most challenging part has been getting back into a genomics headspace, and actually interpreting the outputs of various code runs. It's just a steep learning curve. Next up for me is assembly, and I'm intimidated by it. 

# For last weeks assignment what did you appreciate the most about knitting documents?
It's nice to have the final result - a really nice looking, clean document. But the code evaluations from the knit can be hard to deal with - code works when I'm working through the document, but there are problems when knitting.
