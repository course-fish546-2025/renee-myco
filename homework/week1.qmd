# This class is strongly rooted in an independent project related to genomic analyses. What specific project do you have in mind? If you do not have any data or preference, data can be provided / aquired. If you do not have a specfic project, what approach would you like to master as part of this class?
I have bacterial and fungal metagenomes from soil/root samples from a greenhouse study. There are 46 metagenomes total and on a 10TB drive in my lab. 

# What are two things you found most useful from the reading?
