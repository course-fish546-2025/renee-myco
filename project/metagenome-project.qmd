# Data upload

The goal for week 2 is to upload fastq files to Raven server.
Note that this needs to be done from the local terminal, not the one on the server.

```{bash}
# move files from lab drive to Raven
scp "/Volumes/CRUZER16GB/F1B-KM40_R1_001.fastq.gz" \
rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu:/home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/
```

That was successful.
Now we upload the rest using rsync instead (better for handling multiple files, fewer chances of duplicates, conflicts etc).

```{bash}
# move remaining files from lab drive to Raven
rsync -av --progress \
    /Volumes/CRUZER16GB/*.fastq.gz \
    rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu:/home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/
```

# Data integrity and quality control

## Checksums

Before we begin working, let's run a MD5 check on the 4 metagenome fastq files.

```{bash}
find . -type f -exec md5sum-lite {} \; >> output.txt  #found all files in the working directory, calculated its MD5 checksum, save to an output txt file
```

This prints the results to a text file.
Here is the output:

```         
b24ae50750964ef8d01a8808051c73c7  ./F2R-KM41_R2_001.fastq.gz
a48a5ad0bc4ce07f641c0c647fe0dbaf  ./F1B-KM40_R2_001.fastq.gz
88d5e83290598639d54218bc505bfe66  ./output.txt
a8be224ab035ea641ccd5a8c9d46c024  ./F2R-KM41_R1_001.fastq.gz
e34585c824e429f54ff34d919719f1c4  ./F1B-KM40_R1_001.fastq.gz
```

```{bash}
mv output.txt md5checksums_metagenomes_2025.txt #renamed the file to something more descriptive
```

To validate file integrity later, you could run the following code to ensure a match.

```{bash}
md5sum -c md5checksums_metagenomes_2025.txt
```

## Quality control

### FastQC

I have been told that QC has been run on these, but we won't take that at face value.
For this we will use FastQC.

```{bash}
# run FastQC on the fastq files
/home/shared/FastQC-0.12.1/fastqc -t 36 -o output /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/*.fastq.gz
```

```{bash}
Analysis complete for F2R-KM41_R1_001.fastq.gz
Analysis complete for F2R-KM41_R2_001.fastq.gz
Analysis complete for F1B-KM40_R1_001.fastq.gz
Analysis complete for F1B-KM40_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

.png files downloaded to my desktop.

### MultiQC

```{bash echo=TRUE}
eval "$(/opt/anaconda/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
conda activate
which multiqc

cd output

multiqc .
```

See html report in output folder.

# Preprocessing

We have to preprocess raw data to enable clean, high-quality reads ready for assembly.
This involves 2 steps: trimming and merging forward and reverse reads.

## Trimming using Trimmomatic

We need to trim raw data to remove adapters and low-quality bases.
It's important to do this prior to merging, as merging reads relies on the overlapping region between forward and reverse reads.
If you try to merge before trimming, you could end up with incorrect overlaps, low quality merges, and related issues.

For this step we will use [Trimmomatic](#0), which we will have to install manually.

```{bash}
scp -r ~/Downloads/Trimmomatic-0.39 rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu:/home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee  #from the local terminal
```

Now we will run it to trim adapters and low quality bases.
We'll stick with defaults of greater than or equal to 50 base pairs (bp), and 3 leading and trailing bp.
We will do this in 2 steps with F1B R1/R2 and then F2R R1/R2.

```{bash}
cd /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee
java -jar /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/Trimmomatic-0.39/trimmomatic-0.39.jar PE -threads 4 \

```

These are good numbers.
Generally, anything over 80% both surviving is considered good.
And 1.5% is a very low drop rate.

```{bash}
cd /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/raw-data

TrimmomaticPE: Completed successfully
```

Trimmomatic produces **unpaired** and **paired** file outputs.
Paired reads are those which both forward and reverse survived trimming.
Unpaired reads indicate where only one of the pair survived (the other was discarded due to low quality or short length).

We will use the paired files for most downstream steps like merging and assembly, but will keep the unpaired files around just in case we need to embark on deeper analysis.

## Merging forward and reverse reads using PEAR

These are R1/R2 (forward and reverse reads) and will have to be merged.
This is the last component of pre-processing as we work towards metagenome assembly.For this we will use fastp which is already installed on Raven.

```{bash}
cd /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee

# Merge F1B-KM40
/home/shared/fastp-v0.24.0/fastp \
  -i F1B-KM40_trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz \
  -I F1B-KM40_trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz \
  --merge \
  --merged_out F1B-KM40_merged.fastq.gz \
  
# Merge F2R-KM41
/home/shared/fastp-v0.24.0/fastp \
  -i F2R-KM41_trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz \
  -I F2R-KM41_trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz \
  --merge \
  --merged_out F2R-KM41_merged.fastq.gz \
```

Around 25% of original read pairs got merged, which appears to be typical for paired-end read merging.

As a final step, we'll preview the file and do a quality check on the merged files using FastQC.

```{bash}
# run FastQC on the fastq files
/home/shared/FastQC-0.12.1/fastqc -t 36 -o output /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/*merged.fastq.gz
```

HTML report results: [F1B-KM40_merged.fastq.gz](http://raven.fish.washington.edu:8787/files/renee-myco/project/output/F1B-KM40_merged_fastqc.html); [F2R-KM41_merged.fastq.gz](http://raven.fish.washington.edu:8787/files/renee-myco/project/output/F2R-KM41_merged_fastqc.html).
F1B has higher per base sequence quality, but both look good.

# Next steps (week 4-9)

1.  verify that current code is reproducible (I think I have some problems here)

2.  begin **assembly** of metagenome contigs

3.  marker gene extraction - identify 16S (bacteria) and ITS (fungi) reads

4.  taxonomic classification

5.  visualizations
