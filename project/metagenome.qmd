# Upload raw data files to server

The goal for week 2 is to upload fastq files to Raven server.
Note that this needs to be done in the local terminal, not the one on the server.

```{bash}
scp "/Volumes/CRUZER16GB/F1B-KM40_R1_001.fastq.gz" \
rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu:/home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/
```

Ok that worked, now to upload the rest using rsync instead (better for handling multiple files, fewer chances of duplicates, conflicts etc).

```{bash}
rsync -av --progress \
    /Volumes/CRUZER16GB/*.fastq.gz \
    rendavis@raven.fish.washington.edu:/home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/renee/
```

These are R1/R2 (forward and reverse reads) and will have to be merged.
That will be next week.
I can attempt to follow [this guide](https://www.cureffi.org/2012/12/19/forward-and-reverse-reads-in-paired-end-sequencing/).
Also, need to create some subdirectories to better organize this as there will be some intermediary files.

Question: is this code reproducible?
