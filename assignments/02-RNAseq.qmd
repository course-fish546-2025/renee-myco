Today we will be taking RNA-seq reads off the sequencer, and determining what genes are expressed higher in treatment group A compared to treatments group B. For this we will use Kallisto, which is already installed on Raven. The goal is to generate a plot and table of differentially expressed genes. For this we will be using fastq files. 

# Quality control
Before embarking on any further analysis, we have to do QC on the data. We can do this using FastQC.

```{bash}
fastqc input.fastq
```
