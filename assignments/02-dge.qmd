Today we will be taking RNA-seq reads off the sequencer, and determining what genes are expressed higher in treatment group A compared to treatments group B. For this we will use Kallisto, which is already installed on Raven. The goal is to generate a plot and table of differentially expressed genes.

```
This code grabs the Pacific oyster fasta file of genes. (Note: still awaiting permissiosn to create a directory.)
