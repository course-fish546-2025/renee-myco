**BioBead** is a hydrogel microbial delivery system designed to support plant-microbe symbioses in dynamic soil environments. It serves as both a carrier and a living interface, delivering beneficial fungal, bacterial, or mycorrhizal consortia in bead form to plant roots. As part of my PhD research in CEE, I am expanding into greenhouse and field trials with BioBead.

## üå± Purpose

BioBead enables precise, tunable inoculation strategies in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture. Each bead can be customized to deliver targeted microbial consortia.

We are analyzing the metagenomes from 2 (out of 48) soil samples that were used in a greenhouse study prior to biofertilizer treatment. These will give us a sense of resident microbial (fungal and bacterial) communities residing in them.

-   F1B-KM40 - bulk field soil

-   F2R-KM41 - rhizosphere soil

The goal is to generate phylogenetic trees of bacteria and fungi in these samples, and analyze them for nitrogenase gene (_nif_) abundance. We expect there to be a more diverse commmunity of microbes in the rhizosphere (root zone), and for there to be more _nif_ gene activity. 

## üî¨ Current focus areas

Characterizing microbial activity across soil types and host plant interfaces using isotopic C/N tracing, -omics approaches, and plant growth responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies used

-   Alginate-based encapsulation with fungal and bacterial consortia
-   Microscopy, FISH, and bioinformatics tools (e.g., PEAR, Megahit, Megan, HMMER, Prodigal)

## üöß Status

This repository serves as an open, evolving pipeline for metagenome analysis of greenhouse soil samples from BioBead trials.
